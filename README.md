# **Assignment: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI**

## **Objective**

To evaluate your creativity, understanding, and technical skills in building a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** User Interface. This assignment is designed to give you the flexibility to showcase your problem-solving abilities and your personal approach to designing secure and functional UIs.

> **Note:**
> If you have already implemented an RBAC UI in any project, you can submit that project for evaluation. Be sure to include a detailed description and links to the repository or deployment.
